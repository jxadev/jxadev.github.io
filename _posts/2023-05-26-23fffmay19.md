However, among the few new albums I did listen to, I discovered a set of good releases that deserve recognition. 
Here are the top 10 albums that captivated me this week.

The Ocean is an extraordinary band with an amazing discography. While this particular album starts off with a bit mellower tone, it gradually built up momentum, captivating me completely. I've got addicted to this album very fast, and I personally think it's the band's third best work till date - right after Precambrian and Heliocentric.

This is the most underappreciated releases of this week in my opinion. This is a truly remarkable fusion of atmospheric sludge, funeral doom, and epic doom, creating a captivating mix of emotions encompassing sadness, happiness, and anger! This contains classical high-register doom vocals and also harsh vocals in a perfectly balanced manner. The atmosphere on this album is a top notch, imo. Rating this 2nd in the week list but could be in my year-end AOTY list as this is a slow grower.

    As I'm listening to this band's music for the first time, I find myself completely mesmerized by this album. It's an explosive compilation of technicality, sheer brutality, and breathtaking riffs. The vocal style displayed throughout the album is truly the standout element. Since this album has unquestionably captivated me, I'll definitely explore their previous works. Can't wait to unravel more of their briliant musicianship.

A solid sophomore release from these guys, and they released a remarkable piece of music that will resonate with fans of doom metal. It skillfully combines elements of classic doom metal, atmospheric psychedelia, and post-metal. The instrumental sections are particularly noteworthy, showcasing exceptional musicianship. The guitar work and riffs are beautifully arranged and the psychedelic vocals on this album are truly outstanding, adding an extra layer of brilliance to the overall sound.

This album art and the country of origin of the band immediately caught my attention. The album is incredibly captivating, to the point where I found myself reading and understanding the lyrics of each and every song. An amazing blend of ancient Sri Lankan traditions with a touch of captivating depressive atmosphere makes this album a true standout of the week for me. I'm grateful that I stumbled upon this through the Twitter community.

Gozu, an underappreciated band in the stoner psych rock realm, never fails to impress. If you are into Stoner/Psych/Heavy/Doom/Rock genres, their entire discography is an absolute must-listen. On this particular album, they have exceptional riffs that hit harder than their previous works. It's as if they've expertly crafted a flawless fusion of the distinct styles found in the works of Freedom Hawk, Wo Fat, and Khemmis.

  This is an absolute powerhouse in the realm of extreme death metal. Fans of crushing, bone-shattering music will undoubtedly find themselves enthralled by every single track from this relentless force. Glacial Domination takes a step towards an even heavier direction than their previous two albums, pushing the boundaries of brutality to new heights. ICY CHAOS with ASS FUCKING AGGRESSION.

Don't know why, but there are way too many blackened death metal releases this yeart. But, there are a very few bands out there who pumped me up through their melo-black sounds and these dudes fucking killed it. This is my favorite blackened death album so far. Each album they released is an absolute marvel, accompanied by captivating blue album artwork that adds an extra layer of beauty. While one may draw comparisons to bands like Dissection, Thulcandra manages to transcend mere imitation, showcasing their unique style and artistic vision throughout their entire discography.

This is a intense and brutal punch of aggressive blackened death metal album. It leans more towards black metal but with a strong influence from death metal, resulting in a crushing and filthy sound. It has a satisfying production, avoiding the chaotic production often found in typical blackened death metal releases. If you want to get your ass fucked with some filthy dose of aggressive black metal, this is an absolute must-listen!

 Another underappreciated musical gem from last week, that caught my attention, and I just wanted to to include it here. I discovered this band just this week, and I must say, this album is truly amazing. It delivers a beautiful blend of doomy riffs that rampage through each track, accompanied by classic stoner vibes. These dudes crafted a remarkable piece of work that will satisfy any fan of heavy doom metal!
