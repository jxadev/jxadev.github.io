First-generation ethanol comes from food crops like sugar cane and corn, using sugar and starch fermentation.

Second-generation ethanol is made from non-food sources (agricultural residues, wood) by breaking down complex carbohydrates into simpler sugars. 
Second-generation is more sustainable, using waste materials and avoiding competition with food supplies
