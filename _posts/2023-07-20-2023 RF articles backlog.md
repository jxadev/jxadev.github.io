## Baker O Brien Article
A fine article summarizing RD/SAF and the main legislative pieces out there: IRA, CORSIA, Illinois Tax Credit, and EU mandates
- The article suggests that soybean/canola CI are higher than 50 and likely will not count for 2025's Clean Fuel Tax Credit

## BoB Part 2
Good article explaining how SAF economics has yield debits, capital debits, opex debit; as well as lower LCFS, RINs.
To maintain the same margins as RD production, and therefore encourage SAF produciton, would likely require between $1.35 and $2.70 of additional incentives.
