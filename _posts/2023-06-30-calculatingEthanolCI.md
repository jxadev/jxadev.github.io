DOE GREET vs Corsia

> Producers say the U.S. GREET model, which is run by the Department of Energyâ€™s Argonne National Laboratory, is more accurate than ICAO and does not overly penalize farmers for using land to cultivate crops. They say GREET better considers precision farming tactics that lower emissions like strip-tilling, which uses less diesel fuel emissions than standard tilling, and nitrogen fixation, which reduces the need for nitrogen fertilizer.
