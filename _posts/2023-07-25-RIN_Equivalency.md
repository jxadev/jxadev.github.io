title: Regarding RIN equivalency

>EPA has determined that each type of RIN must be compared to another through a comparison of its fuel value per unit volume to that of pure liquid ethanol fuel. Each gallon of ethanol has about 77,000 Btu (or 0.077 MMBTU), which is thus the definition of a RIN. A useful conversion to study the business case for RINs is to convert the value of the credits to dollars per MMBtu.

>Hereâ€™s the math: $ X/RIN x RIN/0.077 MMBTU =  $ X/MMBTU

>For example, if a project were selling its D3 RINs at $2.90 each, that would be the equivalent of almost $38/MMBTU. With natural gas trading at about $3/MMBTU as of this writing, the value of the RINs are worth over 12 times the value of the natural gas.
